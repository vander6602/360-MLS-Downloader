## Quick Start

### Interactive Menu

```bash
python3 ricoh360-menu.py
```

This launches a full interactive menu where you can:

1. Paste any Ricoh360 tour URL
2. View tour details (address, photographer, room count)
3. Browse all rooms with enhancement status
4. Choose what to download
5. View direct image URLs
6. Estimate total download size before committing

You can also pre-load a tour URL:

```bash
python3 ricoh360-menu.py "https://mls.ricoh360.com/YOUR-TOUR-ID/ROOM-ID"
```

### CLI Mode (Advanced)

```bash
# Download everything from a tour
python3 ricoh360-downloader.py "https://mls.ricoh360.com/TOUR-ID/ROOM-ID"

# Just the tour UUID works too
python3 ricoh360-downloader.py f948586f-1c5c-48dc-81fd-6ef9a09a12c0

# Custom output directory
python3 ricoh360-downloader.py TOUR-URL --output ~/Desktop/my-listing

# Only AI-enhanced images
python3 ricoh360-downloader.py TOUR-URL --enhanced-only

# Only originals (skip enhanced)
python3 ricoh360-downloader.py TOUR-URL --originals-only

# Just grab metadata JSON, no images
python3 ricoh360-downloader.py TOUR-URL --json-only
```

## Usage Guide

### Step 1: Get the Tour URL

Open any Ricoh360 MLS virtual tour in your browser. The URL looks like:

```
https://mls.ricoh360.com/f948586f-1c5c-48dc-81fd-6ef9a09a12c0/c84e8d06-2b82-46a0-991a-8814573e048b
```

The first UUID is the **tour ID**, the second is the current **room ID**. You only need the tour ID — the tool extracts it automatically from any Ricoh360 URL.

### Step 2: Run the Downloader

**Option A — Interactive Menu:**

```bash
python3 ricoh360-menu.py
```

Then select option `1` and paste the URL. The tool will:
- Fetch the tour data from Ricoh360's API
- Show you tour details, room list, and enhancement status
- Let you choose what to download

**Option B — CLI:**

```bash
python3 ricoh360-downloader.py "https://mls.ricoh360.com/TOUR-ID"
```

### Step 3: Use Your Images

Downloaded files are organized like this:

```
ricoh360-Tour-Name/
  tour-data.json              # Full tour metadata
  brand-logo.jpg              # Photographer's brand logo
  tripod-cover.jpg            # Tripod cover overlay
  rooms/
    01-Foyer/
      original.jpg            # Original 360 panorama
      preview.jpg             # Smaller preview version
      enhanced.jpg            # AI-enhanced version
      enhanced-preview.jpg    # Enhanced preview
    02-Kitchen/
      original.jpg
      ...
```

**Image format:** JPEG equirectangular projection — standard 360 format supported by:
- MLS platforms (Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin)
- 360 tour builders (Kuula, CloudPano, Matterport)
- Social media (Facebook 360 photos, YouTube 360)
- VR headsets
- Any panorama viewer

## How It Works

Ricoh360 MLS tours are built with Next.js and store 360 panoramic images in AWS S3. The tool:

1. Extracts the tour UUID from the URL
2. Fetches the Next.js build ID from the main page
3. Calls the Next.js data endpoint to get full tour metadata (rooms, image keys, S3 bucket info)
4. Constructs direct S3 URLs for each panoramic image
5. Downloads images with retry logic and resume support

No authentication required — MLS tour data and images are publicly accessible by design (they're meant to be shared with home buyers).
